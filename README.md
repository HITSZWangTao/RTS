# RTS
We introduce RTS, a novel framework for underground tuber sensing, capable of imaging the cross-sections of underground tubers, including sizes, shapes, and positions, using a 
novel MC-Diffusion model and multi-channel received signal strength data.

We extensively evaluate the imaging capabilities of the RTS and validate its effectiveness across multiple scenarios, including tuber imaging in a static environment, robust imaging under environmental changes, and cross-environment and cross-soil imaging for underground tubers. 

We have released the pre-trained model and part of the corresponding data files in releases, which can be used for performance testing.
