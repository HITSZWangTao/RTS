# RTS
We introduce RTS, a novel framework for underground tuber sensing, capable of imaging the cross-sections of underground tubers, including sizes, shapes, and positions, using a 
novel MC-Diffusion model and multi-channel received signal strength data.

We extensively evaluate the imaging capabilities of the RTS and validate its effectiveness across multiple scenarios, including tuber imaging in a static environment, robust imaging under environmental changes, and cross-envrionment and cross-soil imaging for underground tubers.
