# RTS
We introduce RTS, a novel framework for underground tuber sensing, capable of imaging the cross-sections of underground tubers, including sizes, shapes, and positions, using a 
novel MC-Diffusion model and multi-channel received signal strength data. We extensively evaluate the imaging capabilities of the RTS and validate its effectiveness across multiple scenarios, including tuber imaging in a static environment, robust imaging under environmental changes, and cross-environment and cross-soil imaging for underground tubers.

For data collection, we design a testbed named Spin, which includes various containers and a rotating platform.

To evaluate the performance of the RTS framework, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of data from a static environment (Case 1), a fixed environment with dynamic changes (Case 2), and various environments with diverse soil conditions (Case 3).

We have released the pre-trained model and part of the corresponding data files in releases, which can be used for performance testing. 

## 1 Visualization Results
Some visualization results of the RTS framework and baseline methods are shown below. For demonstration purposes, we present imaging results from a static environment, a fixed environment with dynamic changes, and across different environments.
